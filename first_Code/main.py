#if you are adding strings together then you can ONLY
#add strings together for the print function
#print("Sum is: " + sum) where sum is a int will NOT work
#print("Sum is: ", sum) will work
#float() this is for converting string into float
#int() this is for converting string into int
#bool() this is for converting string into bool
#str() for converting into string

#example code
#first = input("First: ")
#second = input("Second: ")
#sum = float(first) + float(second)
#print("Sum is:", sum)

#when you want to change a string you have to mkae a new string
#course = "Python for beginners"
#returns the index of the first character
#print(course.replace('for', '4'))
#print(course)
#this returns the boolean value so true/false
#print("Python" in course)

#arthmatic operators
#print(10 / 3) #returns a 3.33333
#print(10 // 3) #returns a 3
#print(10 ** 3) #this is exponent
#x = 10
#x += 3
#print(x)

# if you want to print elements of a list starting a particular point and ending at another
#then you just do print(name[0:3]), which prints names starting at index 0, and ending at index
#3 but NOT including index 3, only up to index 3
#numbers = range(5), which now has the range from 0 - 5 but not including 5

#tuples
#we use [ to define a list however ( to design a tuple
#so numbers = (1, 2, 3) is a tuple can be any elements
